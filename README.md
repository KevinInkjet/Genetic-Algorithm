# Sudoku Solver using Genetic Algorithm in Python

This is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. The algorithm uses a population of candidate solutions, evolves them through selection, crossover, and mutation to produce better solutions, until a solution with no conflicts is found.


## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- `numpy`
- `random`
- `statistics`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy random statistics matplotlib
```


## Usage

To use the code, simply download or clone the repository and run `sudoku.py`:

```
python sudoku.py
```

The code will generate a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle and solve it using a genetic algorithm. The output will be the solved Sudoku puzzle printed to the console and a plot of the fitness values over generations.
